# tox4go

For now, tox4go is just a collection of tools for Tox written in Go. It also
contains other helpful things like (de)serializers for the state format and some
Tox packets (currently only the DHT packets are covered).

This is not intended to be a full reimplementation of toxcore but it may
eventually become one.
